# No Jefferys

I saw a meme where somebody could not be hired because the name Jeffery could not work with their table schema.
Not sure how, but I made my own to see how this would have happened. This seems unlikely to have been written
intentionally so I think there's some other weird constraint that actually made it happen.

Not for real use! Also doesn't really work, I just whipped this up for fun.
